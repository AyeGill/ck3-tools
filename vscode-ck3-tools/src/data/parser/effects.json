Since that will always be between -20 and 20 (unless you do something very unusual), and typically in a more narrow range than that, we should stick to those ranges.\nOnly use larger weights if you want the duel_value to have a smaller impact on the weighting, and only use smaller weights if you want the duel_value to have a huge impact on the weighting.\nIn addition, it is fully possible for the compare_modifier to reduce the weight to 0, which would mean that it will not be possible to happen at all. I've requested code support to make it so that we can define min and max values for weights, but until further notice we should use ranges that are guaranteed to not hit 0, or include min values in the compare_modifier itself.\nLastly, remember that if you want the outcome of a duel to scale linearly from (almost) 0% to (almost) 100%, the duel_value should be applied 50% to the good outcome, and -50% to the bad outcome. If you only apply it on one side, you will retain a (presumably significant) chunk of chance for the other outcome.",
